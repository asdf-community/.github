# ASDF Community

## What is asdf-community?

asdf-community is a collaborative, community-driven project for long-term
maintenance of plugins for the [asdf version manager](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf#readme) tool. (This organization is inspired by a coq-community
project with a similar name.)

## Who runs this GitHub organization?

This organization is run by volunteers, including core members and outside
collaborators of [asdf-vm](https://github.com/asdf-vm/), [plugin authors, and maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/asdf-vm/people).

## How do I move plugins here?

If you are a plugin author or maintainer interested in moving your plugins to
this community organization, please feel free to start a discussion at this
repository or send an e-mail to <sora@morimoto.io> and/or <vborja@apache.org>.

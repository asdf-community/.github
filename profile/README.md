# Welcome to the asdf-community organisation!

## What is the asdf-community?

asdf-community is a collaborative, community-driven project for the long-term
maintenance of asdf plugins. (This organisation is inspired by a coq-community
project with a similar name.)

## Who runs this GitHub organisation?

This organisation is run by volunteers, including core members and outside
collaborators of asdf-vm, plugin authors, and maintainers.

## How do I move plugins here?

If you are a plugin author or maintainer interested in moving your plugins to
this community organisation, please feel free to start a discussion at this
repository or send an e-mail to <sora@morimoto.io> and/or <vborja@apache.org>.

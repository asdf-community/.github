# Welcome to the asdf-community organisation!

## What is the asdf-community?

asdf-community is a collaborative, community-driven project for the long-term maintenance of asdf plugins. (This organisation is inspired by a coq-community project with a similar name.)

## Who runs this GitHub organisation?

This organisation is run by volunteers, including core members and outside collaborators of asdf-vm, plugin authors, and maintainers.

## How do I move plugins here?

Consult the [GUIDELINES.md](../GUIDELINES.md) page to move the plugin to the organisation.
